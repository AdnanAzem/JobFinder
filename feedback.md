Adnan,
Your Hackathon project is really great! I like the idea and the final result.
You used all the topics and tools we learned in class, and you weren’t afraid to try new things.
You managed the use of AI and Tkinter very well—it's impressive!
The code is readable, clean, and well-structured.
You also did a great job preventing user errors and creating a good user interface.
You did an excellent job!
